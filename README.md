# GIOpt
GIOpt is my attempt at recreating the damage formula for Genshin Impact, inspired by the genshin-optimizer by frzyc.

## Structure
As of right now, the structure is completely open to change. The plan is to create a calculation "engine",
make a specialization for genshin (key type & key mappings), and then start copying some basic character data.
